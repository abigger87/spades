## Overview

Current mints sacrifice both price-discovery and gas efficiency for ordering.

This leads to gas wars and bag shilling, often enabled by gated whitelists.

[Spades](https://github.com/abigger87/spades) is an attempt to maximize the ERC721 drop tradeoff by building off of [Cloaks](https://github.com/abigger87/cloaks).

TL;DR - [Spades](https://github.com/abigger87/spades) is an ERC721 with a builtin commit-reveal scheme to determine the initial clearing price of an LBP.

## How it works

Spades is an ERC721 Token with built-in minting broken down into four phases.

#### Phase 1 - Commitments

Spades begins with a commit phase that lasts from `commitStart` to `revealStart`.

During the commit phase, anyone can permissionlessly call the `commit(bytes32)` function, passing in a hashed commitment (32 bytes).

The hashed commitment includes an appraisal price (at which each ERC721 token should be valued) along with a `blindingFactor` that prevents hash table attacks.

Calling the commitment also requires a `depositAmount` of ether or the `depositToken` to prevent commitment spam.

#### Phase 2 - Reveals

At this point, there are a bunch of commitments stored in the Spades Contract.

Once the Reveal Phase begins when the `block.timestamp` reaches `revealStart`, participants from phase 1 can reveal their appraisal by calling the `reveal(uint256,bytes32)` function.

Where the first argument is the appraisal value and the second is the `blindingFactor`.

Once this function is called, the sender's sealed appraisal becomes public.

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE ‚ö†Ô∏è If a commit phase participant fails to reveal their commitment, they will incur the Spade's `MAX_LOSS_PENALTY` (in bips) on their deposit. After the reveal phase, the user may call `lostReveal()` to extract the remainder of their deposit.

#### Phase 3 - Restricted Mint

When the timestamp reaches `restrictedMintStart`, the reveal phase ends and the Restricted mint period begins.

Since all appraisals have been revealed, a `clearingPrice` can be calculated as the mean of all committed appraisals.

This is the starting mint price.

Participants who revealed their appraisals can now call `restrictedMint()` to mint one ERC721 token at a **discounted** price.

Calling `restrictedMint()` requires the discounted price to be sent in ether or will be transferred from the user for the specified `depositToken`.

Where the discount is proportional to how close their appraisal value was to the calculated `clearingPrice`.

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE ‚ö†Ô∏è Outliers (normally a zscore of 3, but for tighter bounds Spades uses a zscore of 2) cannot mint.

Also note, the max discount factor is 2,000 bips or 20% off the `clearingPrice`.

To view their discount price, a particpant can call the `restrictedMintPrice()` function.

To check restricted minting eligibility, a participany can call the `canRestrictedMint()` function.

Additionally, a user can choose to `forgo()` their mint allocation (outliers must do this to recover part of their deposit).

The `forgo()` function will return the `depositAmount` less a loss penalty inversely related to how close their appraisal was to the `clearingPrice`.

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE ‚ö†Ô∏è Outliers will lose the `MAX_LOSS_PENALTY`.

#### Phase 4 - Public LBP

At this point, if not all ERC721 tokens are minted (`tokenSupply < MAX_TOKEN_SUPPLY`), minting is enabled for everyone, including non-commitment participants.

When `block.timestamp` is greater than or equal to `publicMintStart`, the `mint(uint256)` function can be called, supplying the number of tokens to be minted.

The public `mint` function requires ether to be sent or the `depositToken` will be transferred at an initial amount equal to the `clearingPrice` (or the `minPrice` if `clearingPrice < minPrice`).

**With one important caveat** - the price to mint is modeled after an LBP.

That is, on each new token minted, the price to mint another token increase by `priceIncreasePerMint` and on each new block, the price decreases by `priceDecayPerBlock`.

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE ‚ö†Ô∏è no more than `MAX_MINT_PER_ACCOUNT` can be minted per account (except for the commitment participants who can mint `MAX_MINT_PER_ACCOUNT + 1`).


## Motivation

Essentially the same as [cloaks](https://github.com/abigger87/cloaks).

Mints suck...

They're difficult to mint, oft impossible.

The mint price is fixed - artists and creators don't realize upside.

Whitelists, gating methods, and gas wars prevent any semblance of a fair mint.

## Development

A [Spade](https://github.com/abigger87/spades) is an extensible ERC721 implementation with a commit-reveal scheme and lbp built _into_ the ERC721 contract itself.
The only contract is located in [src/](./src/) called [Spade](./src/Spade.sol).

It is an abstract contract and requires an implementation for `tokenURI` as in [MockSpade](./src/test/mocks/MockSpade.sol);

Both [DappTools](https://dapp.tools/) and [Foundry](https://github.com/gaskonst/foundry) are supported. Installation instructions for both are included below.

#### Install DappTools

Install DappTools using their [installation guide](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation).

#### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Don't have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed?
Run
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

üéâ Foundry is installed! üéâ

#### Setup

```bash
make
# OR #
make setup
```

#### Build

```bash
make build
```

#### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

#### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.
